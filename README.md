## Notes

- A new user who registers will initially not have any recommendations in the "For you" section on the mobile application. Only after purchasing travel tickets will they receive recommendations.

- A user order is considered complete once the administrator activates it. Activation means entering the order ID in the activation form on the desktop application (intended to be done in retail by scanning a QR code). At that point, the administrator is given the option to print travel tickets. Tickets can only be printed once. The administrator also has the option to reprint them later, and the print button is located in the order details. For this reason, the order ID is displayed in the details, and filtering is also done by it.

- Statistics take into account only orders with the status COMPLETE and EXPIRED, as those are the statuses where the revenue amount is final.

- Only the user who purchased tickets for a particular trip can leave a review for it, and only after that trip has ended.

- When reviewing completed trips (status COMPLETE), the administrator can also access reviews for that trip. Unwanted reviews can be removed.

- The flag icons correspond to real country codes.

- All notifications within the application are sent **exclusively via e-mail**.

- Additionally, in the case of opening a support ticket, the administratorâ€™s response is sent to the user via email.
